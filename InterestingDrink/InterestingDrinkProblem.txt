Problem 1:
Interesting drink — Version

Vasiliy likes to rest after a hard work, so you may often meet him in some bar nearby.
As all programmers do, he loves the famous drink "Beecola",
which can be bought in n different shops in the city.
It is known that the price of one bottle in the shop i is equal to xi coins.

Vasiliy plans to buy his favorite drink for q consecutive days.
He knows that on the i-th day he will be able to spend mi coins.
Now, for each of these days, he wants to know in how many different shops he can buy a bottle of "Beecola".

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of shops selling the drink.
The second line contains n integers xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100000) — the price of the drink in each shop.
The third line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) — the number of days.
Then follow q lines, each containing one integer mi (1 ≤ mi ≤ 1000000000) — the amount of money Vasiliy can spend on the i-th day.

Output
Print q integers. The i-th integer must be the number of shops where Vasiliy can buy the drink on the i-th day.
